# ARTOUR
ARTOUR Marketplace was final project of the BootCamp I took. This marketplace that connects artists and buyers from all over the world.
•	Client-side was developed in React (Functional and classes).
•	In this project, I designed and developed a sophisticated CMS system for:
- Management of users- user can register to the Marketplace, update his details. 
- Management of content and dynamic pages-
An artist who is responsible for specific artwork can update some details about the work. He also can add another artwork or delete one from his works.

ARTOUR Marketplace can be found at: https://artourmarket.herokuapp.com/#/
